# gogl - Go Generic Library

This is a collection of experiments in writing generic containers and algorithms
in Go, with [iterators](https://go.dev/blog/range-functions).

I don't recommend using this module as a dependency in your code - it's not
guaranteed to be stable, and the APIs may change at any time. For this
reason the repository doesn't have actual tags / releases. Feel
free to copy any code you like into your project, however. It's well
tested and in the
[public domain](https://github.com/eliben/gogl/blob/main/LICENSE).
